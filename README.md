## Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses, especially in competitive industries like banking. This project leverages machine learning models to predict customer churn and uncover actionable insights.

The notebook includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering
- Implementation of machine learning models
- Performance evaluation

---

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis includes information about bank customers, such as:
- Demographics (e.g., age, gender, geography)
- Account details (e.g., balance, tenure)
- Transactional data (e.g., credit score, number of products)

Data preprocessing ensures the dataset is ready for modeling, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

---

## Preprocessing

Key preprocessing steps include:
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., geography and gender)
- Standardizing numerical features
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA provides insights into the data distribution and relationships between features. Highlights include:
- Visualization of churn rates across various demographics
- Correlation heatmaps
- Analysis of influential features like credit score and balance

---

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering focuses on creating and selecting features that enhance model performance:
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features
- Adding interaction terms if applicable

---

## Modeling

This project utilizes multiple machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)

Each model is trained and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

---

## Evaluation

Model performance is assessed using:
- Confusion matrices
- ROC curves
- Feature importance plots

---

## Results

The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics, with insights drawn from feature importance analysis. Recommendations for reducing churn are provided based on these insights.
